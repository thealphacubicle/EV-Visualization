## Project Overview

This research project delves into the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in Washington State, underpinned by supportive policies, technological advancements, and increasing environmental awareness. Through data-driven analytics, we aim to uncover patterns and factors driving this trend, offering insights into the broader implications for society and the environment.

## Key Findings

- **Electric Vehicle Adoption:** Washington State's EV adoption is significantly propelled by tax rebates, investments in charging infrastructure, and public education campaigns.
- **Geographic Distribution:** The distribution across the state highlights urban centers like Seattle as leading hubs for EV adoption, underscoring potential areas for growth.
- **EV Adoption Over Time:** A remarkable growth in BEV and PHEV registrations from 2013 to 2023 showcases the state's commitment to sustainable transportation.
- **Market Share by EV Type:** Tesla's dominance in the BEV market and a varied landscape in the PHEV market reflects diverse consumer preferences and manufacturer strategies.
- **Utility Providers' Role:** Key utility firms, such as Puget Sound Energy, play a vital role in supporting the EV infrastructure, highlighting the importance of energy provision to EV consumers.

## Introduction to the Data

The Electric Vehicle Population Dataset from the Washington State Department of Licensing provides a comprehensive look at the current state of EV registrations, featuring data from 1997 to 2024. Key dataset details include:
